      Dr. Travis Bradberry wrote an article on Quartz that discussed problems with the eight-hour workday, notably that it is "outdated" and not "effective".
    </p>
  
  <p>Dr. Travis Bradberry recently wrote about the problem with the eight-hour work day in his <a href="https://qz.com/work/1561830/why-the-eight-hour-workday-doesnt-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> on Quartz, arguing that an eight-hour workday is <em>not</em> productive, and in fact does more harm than good.</p>
<p>As a director and team leader, I spend a lot of time thinking about how I can make my team <em>happy</em>, and remove obstacles that <em>reduce</em> their productivity (i.e. I take more meetings so they don’t have to). While it is true that organizational policy places constraints on what I can do, I do think about what types of changes I would make with my team if permitted.</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes I would make is greater time flexibility. The work my team does is very tedious, and often requires a lot of mental gymnastics for best results. Forcing them to work for a specific amount of time doesn’t necessarily result in their best performance.</p>
<p>Bradberry cites psychological research done by the Draugiem Group that suggests a specific pattern of work (“work-to-break ratio”) where a pattern of 52 minutes of work followed by 17 minutes of rest often resulted in higher performance. This aligns with other research such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pomodoro Technique</a> that suggests humans work best when we can work for _X_ amount of time, and then rest for _Y_ amount of time.</p>
<p>The eight-hour workday often does feel like a relic from the past, from a time when daylight and industrial production meant that employers needed a specific amount of productivity from their employees. As the global workforce has embraced more and more office jobs over the past 100 years, it stands to reason that the eight-hour workday is worth re-evaluating. I think most organizations would trade an arbitrary, eight-hour workday in favor of a schedule that yielded better employee performance. I certainly would with my team.</p>
