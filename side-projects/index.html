    <p class="post-intro">
      I recently watched a presentation on side projects that's inspired me to continue working on tackling my ever-growing list of side projects.
    </p>
  
  <p>Last week, I ‚Äúattended‚Äù the <a href="https://5to9.co/" title="5to9 design conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5to9 design conference</a>, a conference by and for side hustlers, freelancers, and others who generally do work outside of full time jobs (hosted by the lovely folks of <a href="https://designx.community/" title="DesignX Community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DesignX Community</a>). And by ‚Äúattended‚Äù, I mean that I logged on during work breaks and meal times to catch videos of sessions that interested me (as is becoming the norm for online conferences in COVID-19 times it seems). </p>
<p>One session in particular really spoke to me. <a href="https://kez.ie/" title="Kezie Todd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kezie Todd</a>, a UX designer at Puppet, gave a presentation called, <em>12 Side Projects in 12 Months</em> that chronicled her journey of completing 12 side projects in a year, all in varying mediums (you can read more about them on <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/a-year-in-side-projects-2ae0ffbb0938" title="A Year in Side Projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this blog post</a>). </p>
<p>Kezie‚Äôs presentation came at an interesting time for me. Since this past winter, I‚Äôve made considerable effort to tackle some of these side projects head-on (COVID-19 has helped free up time for this, admittedly). The thought of completing 12 projects in a year is <em>daunting</em>, and I know I‚Äôd never have the time to commit to that amidst my current obligations. But what I <em>can</em> do is commit to completing at <em>least</em> one side project this year, and hopefully increase that number next year.  In more ways than one, her presentation inspired me to keep working towards that goal. </p>
<p>I‚Äôve kept a running list of side projects I want to pursue for a few years now. Some of them are silly. Some of them are insane. Some of them will require significant time and financial investment. Some of them I‚Äôll probably never start. Some of them will probably result in numerous eye-rolls from my wife. But, all of them represent ideas I‚Äôve had to push myself and learn new skills. And as new side project ideas pop into my head, I add them to the ‚Äúlist‚Äù (in no particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a piece of mid-century modern-inspired furniture</li>
<li>Buy and work on a project car (notably one with a V8 engine)</li>
<li>Use 3D/motion software to create an abstract video</li>
<li>Write, produce, direct, and edit a film</li>
<li>Continue learning how to play an instrument (right now it‚Äôs violin, but who knows what the future holds)</li>
<li>Compose a song for said instrument</li>
<li>Learn <a href="https://reactjs.org/" title="React" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React</a></li>
<li>Develop <em>something</em> using React</li>
<li>Write and publish a short story or novel</li>
<li>Write and publish a freelance article for a magazine (or two)</li>
<li>Design and develop a website to help kidney stone patients identify foods high in <em>calcium oxalate</em> (calcium oxalate is a known trigger for some types of kidney stone formation)</li>
<li>Design and develop a website for bourbon whiskey enthusiasts to discover recommendations</li>
<li>Learn how to illustrate on an iPad in <a href="https://procreate.art/" title="Procreate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Procreate</a></li>
<li>Make an illustration based on what I‚Äôve learned in Procreate</li>
<li>Develop a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music" title="Sheet music" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sheet music</a> inspired CSS theme (for static-site generators)</li>
<li>Design an interface or <em>something</em> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality" title="Augmented reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">augmented reality</a></li>
<li>Cook <a href="https://www.mustsee.is/recipe-month-icelandic-pancakes/" title="Icelandic pancakes recipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Icelandic pancakes</a> and film the process</li>
<li>Design, develop, and write a blog based on my genealogy interests</li>
<li>Design a typeface and publish it</li>
<li>Design and develop an iOS app using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/" title="Swift" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swift programming language</a></li>
<li>Design and develop a coffee preparation website</li>
</ul>
<p>Right now I‚Äôm juggling two side projects from that list, hoping to complete one of them sometime in September, and another in the next year (although I keep moving the goal post on it, so it‚Äôs possible it won‚Äôt be coming anytime soon üòâ). I‚Äôll write a blog post when there‚Äôs more to share üòé.</p>
<p>Side projects, to me, are very important, and I find them to be an invaluable component of <em>my</em> self-care regimen. To me, side projects are a way to work on something <em>without</em> constraints, a way to learn <em>new</em> skills, sharpen <em>existing</em> skills, exercise <em>creativity</em>, and as Kezie pointed out in her presentation, <em>have fun</em>! </p>
<p>Even if I don‚Äôt complete any of those side projects, the time spent learning new things and discovering new interests is something I cherish, and is an investment in <em>myself</em> that‚Äôs not wasted. </p>
<p>Maybe now that I‚Äôve made my side projects list public (a scary thing to be sure), someone will hold me <em>accountable</em>. Maybe that‚Äôs <em>you</em>. Who knows? </p>
