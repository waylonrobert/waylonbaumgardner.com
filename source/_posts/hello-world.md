One of my goals for 2019 was to finally launch a redesign of my personal site, and to start writing again.

So, I'm pleased to present to you the latest version of my personal site &mdash; welcome! I hope you like the fresh coat of paint.

This is probably the third or fourth redesign of my personal site I've worked on in the past year. None of those were ever published, instead the source code and various Sketch/Adobe XD files lay dormant on my computer (and will probably stay there).

Some of the goals I wanted to accomplish with this redesign:

* Break out of my default blue/teal color scheme (though I can't promise the current "Ruby" color will stay)

* Write the stylesheet using pure CSS (including [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables "CSS custom properties")) and not rely on Sass (though I do miss some of its features)

* Rely on as little Javascript as possible

* Build with a static site generator (I'm using [Hexo](https://hexo.io "Hexo - a static site generator") for this version)

* Try hosting with Netlify or AWS (going with Netlify for the time being)

I have a lot of other improvements I want to make, but for now I'm happy to be back writing again and this change feels good.
