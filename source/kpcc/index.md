Launched in January 2012, KPCC 89.3 Southern California Public Radio's website redesign was designed to be more engaging to current listeners, attract new listeners, and help promote KPCC as a leading, unbiased news source for Southern California.

Working in a freelance capacity alongside SCPR's UX team, I was tasked with developing front-end templates and patterns in support of the redesign, including the homepage.

My approach was to review the design materials provided and ensure what I was building was faithful to the design. This meant that my decision-making had to account for the appropriate color, spacing, and overall feel, especially when the decisions weren't obvious.

Tools and Technologies Used:

* Adobe Photoshop
* Sublime Text editor
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
