The team also did a deep dive of other university websites as well as websites from other industries in order to identify user patterns and understand how other sites were working (or not working). Some of the work we did, in no particular order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Design questions for user research</li>\n<li>Sketch mobile and desktop wireframes focused on content</li>\n<li>Develop HTML and CSS templates for protoyping</li>\n<li>Build information architecture based on results from card sorting and task based testing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on the data and insights collected, the team adhered to a mobile-first, task-based methodology. Development of the site focused on <em>agile software development methodology</em>, particularly by organizing features into iterations.</p>\n<p>Before launch, we conducted a round of user tests to hone the design, and successfully launched the first iteration in September 2016. Since then, subsequent iterations have focused on improvements to typography, spacing, interface improvements, and redesigned academic program pages.</p>\n"},{"title":"CBU Marketing Projects System","date":"2019-02-24T01:14:06.000Z","home":"y","displayWork":"y","description":"Marketing Projects Web Application for California Baptist University","_content":"\n**Responsibilities:** Product design; Project management; User research, experience design, and testing; User-interface design; Front-end development\n\n![Screenshot of CBU Marketing Projects System showing two screens: one is a Dashboard with a list of projects, another is a Report view with an at-a-glance pie chart breaking down the percentage of projects by status](/images/cbu-marketing-projectrequests-min.png)\n\nWith an enrollment of over 10,000 students, and over 1,000 employees, CBU’s marketing unit is tasked with providing the university with professional marketing services across print, digital, and advertising verticals.
